<p><strong style="color: #7EECF4;">RUNNER</strong>/<strong style="color: #FFFFFF;">GRIDLOCK</strong> is a real-time action rogue-like. You control a <strong style="color: #7EECF4;">RUNNER</strong> and you must drift, dodge, and steal your way through an abstract procedural city.</p>

    <blockquote>Too late, you notice the tell-tale glint of a laser designator dancing across your visual sensors as you
        cross a crowded intersection at high speed. They've got a lock on you. You drift hard to the north. Hopefully you
        can break their lock with a detour through the alley ahead and still make it to the exit with your package intact.
